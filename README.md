# Localization of kidnapped vehicle

## 2-D Particle Filter
Bayesian filters play a critical role in sensor fusion and solving  hard localization problems. While we can use Unscented Kalman filter to fuse measurements from Lidar and Radar sensors, particle filters can be used to locolize a vehicle in a known(mapped) area, with known landmark locations. 

Particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide) in a simulator environment. At each time step filter will also get observation and control data.
